# Task 4 & 5

# **Introduction**

This task is centered at using Pivot tables and its functions on excel spreadsheet to create a detailed visualization of medical students records from the provided dataset.

# **Activity**
A medical students' dataset was provided by Coach Chinonso to create pivot tables from the below activity and to also visualize the insights obtained from pivot tables created;
1. The average values of males and females age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol
2. The average height and weight for both genders, in two (2) decimal places
3. The total number of students across the different blood groups
4. The total number of students who smoke and those who do not smoke.
5. The total number of students who have diabetes and those without diabetes.

# **Skills Demonstrated**
1. Data Cleaning
2. Creating Pivot tables
3. Data Visualization of the pivot tables using pivot charts

# **Data Cleaning**
The raw dataset provided had 13 columns and 200,000 rows with each column mixed up with empty blank cells, which was filled with the average value of each column calculated. Thereafter the entire data was converted into a table by highlighting the entire data then 'Control T' and I adjusted the header to fit into the column appropriately. The screenshots of the raw data, the cleaned data and the values filled into the raw dataset can be seen below.

# **Creating Pivot Tables**
To carryout my first activity required creating a pivot table to determine the average medical data. Firstly I highlighted a cell in the cleaned data table, then clicked on 'insert ribbon' then I selected 'Pivot table' after which I chose a particular cell of that worksheet, where I wanted pivot table to be displayed. The pivot table fields box popped-up containing all the headers on my table, then I dragged the 'Gender' to the 'rows' section, and then the 'age', 'BMI', 'temperature', 'heart rate', 'blood pressure' and 'cholesterol' of males and females, were dragged to the 'values' section of the pivot table section, this automatically developed a pivot table showing the summation of the data I dragged to the 'value' section into six columns. I right-clicked on the 'sum of BMI' header then summarized the values by 'average', this I did across the new six columns created as seen on the pivot table 1.

The second activity of this task to create a pivot table showing the average weight and height of the male and female gender was done by highlighting a cell in the cleaned raw data table, then I clicked on 'insert ribbon' then I selected 'Pivot table' then clicked an empty cell, in the previous worksheet where I displayed 'Pivot table 1'. Then the pivot table fields box popped-up containing the all the headers on my table then I dragged the 'Gender' to the 'rows' section,
then the height and weight, were dragged to the 'values' section of the pivotTable section, this automatically developed a pivot table showing the summation of the height and weight in columns, with their grandtotal, I changed the 'sum' to 'average' by right-clickling to summarize the values to 'Average of Height' and 'Average of Weight' then I right-clicked to remove the grandtotal. The values were highlighted then I clicked on the 'decrease decimal' arrow on the 'home ribbon' to reduce the values 2 decimal places. This can be seen in the screenshot above.

The third activity on this task I inserted a new Pivot table, then I dragged the 'students ID' to the 'value' section, and the 'blood type' to the 'row' section this produced a pivot table showing the summation of students, I changed the 'sum' to 'count' hence this produced the total number of students and their different blood type. 
The fourth activity on this task I inserted a new Pivot table, then I dragged the 'students ID' to the 'value' section and the 'smoking' to the 'row' section this produced a pivot table showing the summation of students, I changed the 'sum' to 'count' hence this produced the total number of students smoking, and those who do not smoke. 
To determine the total number of diabetic students I inserted a new Pivot table, the pivot table fields box popped-up containing the all the headers on my table then I dragged the 'Diabetes' to the 'row' section and the 'Student ID' to the 'value' section this produced a pivot table showing the summation of students, I changed the 'sum' to 'count' hence this produced the total number of diabetic students, and non-diabetic students. I also removed the grandtotal from this section.

# **Data Visualization of the pivot tables using pivot charts**

Data visualisation of the pivot tables requires the detailed presentation of the dataset calculated in a chart format to give a better view and a good understanding of the entire worked done. This was demonstrated on each of the pivot tables created.

Pivot Table 1: The average values of males and females age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol.

<img width="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Jessie-Watt/Critical-Analysis-of-Medical-Students-Health-Records/assets/140435577/377c2308-de58-4e20-9872-70fc49953f29">

A cell in Pivot table 1 was clicked, then I selected 'pivotchart' on the 'insert ribbon' this displayed the 'all chart' field where I selected the 'column chart' then moved the chart to new worksheet. I removed the field buttons, chart text, and inserted a text box describing the the chart as the 'Average Medical data of students',The legends were left because the column bars were too many to identify each medical data. I also performed the same steps on Pivot table 2, 3, 4 and 5. For pivot table 4 and 5, I used a doughnut chart and a pie chart because the point considered were few compared to the pivot table 1. I also used a bar chart for pivot table 3. After creating the 5 pivotcharts I designed the bars from dark blue to light blue colours identifying the highest to the lowest values.  a slicer was inserted to visualize the chart when considering just females or males.  I also inserted a rectangular shape behind the charts, then grouped the charts, the slicer and the header together. The screenshot of the data visuals of the pivot tables can be seen above.


# **Conclusion**
This task broadened my use of pivot tables and its functions to visualize on excel spreadsheet, I look forward to using these functions in my personal practice.
